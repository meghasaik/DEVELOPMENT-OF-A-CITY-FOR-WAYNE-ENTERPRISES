# DEVELOPMENT-OF-A-CITY-FOR-WAYNE-ENTERPRISES
The main idea of this project was to develop a city for Wayne Enterprises. This was done using a RED-BLACK TREE AND MINIMUM HEAP. Also, we must keep a track of what all buildings are been constructed and what buildings have to be constructed in the future
